# Sales-of-food-delivery-company

Here's the problem statement:

Your client is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various fulfillment centers in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers. The client wants to help these centers with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks to plan the stock of raw materials accordingly.

The replenishment of the majority of raw materials is done weekly, and since the raw material is perishable, procurement planning is of utmost importance. Secondly, staffing of the centers is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are really helpful. We have the below information with us in the form of 3 different datasets:

Historical data of demand for a product-center combination

Product (Meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price, and discount

Information for fulfillment centers like center area, city information, etc.

You can download the dataset from here.

You need to come up with a story in Power BI that talks about the level of demand in each center. This analysis needs to be granular enough to include product information as well. The client wants an end-to-end report to understand which fulfillment areas are doing well and which aren't. You can also talk about center-meal combinations to add nuance to your final submission.

Your report/dashboard should answer the following questions posed by the Sales Director of the client:

What is the total number of orders catered by the firm? There should be a date filter in the dashboard. You can assume a year to contain 52 weeks of transaction records. 
What is the revenue earned by the firm (Check out Price * Number of orders)?
What is the total discounted value (Base Price - Check out Price) * Number of orders? What is the overall discount % (Total discounted value/Total Base Revenue)?
What are the top 5 selling categories?
Does the operational area of the store influence number of orders?
Are emails and product features on the homepage an effective mode of promotion?
What will be the next 5-week forecasted weekly quantity sold for each center, city, and meal category (You may use a simple trend-based forecasting method)?
